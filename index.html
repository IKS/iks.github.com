        Interactive Knowledge Stack (IKS) is an <a href="http://www.iks-project.eu/">open source community</a>, whose projects are focused on building an open and flexible technology platform for semantically enhanced Content Management Systems (CMS). The software libraries hosted at our github repositories are focussed on interacting with semantic enriched content. They are built as widgets and applications on top of the VIE framework.
